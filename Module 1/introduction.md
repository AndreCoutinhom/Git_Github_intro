## ****Introduction to GitHub****

Linux development in the early 2000â€™s was managed under a free-to-use system known as
BitKeeper.
In 2005, BitKeeper changed to a for-fee system which was problematic for Linux developers
for many reasons.
Linus Torvalds led a team to develop a replacement source-version control system.
The project ran in a short a timeframe and the key characteristics were defined by a
small group.
