## ****GitHub Repositories****

Remember, a repository is a data structure for storing documents including application
source code which tracks and maintains version-control.
An organization is a collection of user accounts that owns repositories.
Organizations have one or more owners, who have administrative privileges for the organization.

###

The heart of a Git-based project is the repository.
This contains all your code and the related artifacts, including things like:
A README file to describe the purpose of the project.
A license to express the ways in which people can use your code, Etc.
You can also make your repository private (only available to people with accounts that
have permission to see it) or public (searchable and seen by everyone).

###

Git was initially created as a source code repository and now all sorts of files end
up in here.
