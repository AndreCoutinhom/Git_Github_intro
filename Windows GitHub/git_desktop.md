# Using Git Commands from your Desktop

I​n the previous lab you used a Cloud-based IDE to work with Git commands. In many cases, you will be developing code on your own workstation on your desktop/laptop. Linux systems  typically come pre-installed with Git commands or if needed you can install them using dnf on rpm based distributions (e.g. Red Hat / Fedora):

###

*sudo dnf install git-all*

###

o​r, **apt** on Debian-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu):

###

*sudo apt install git-all*

###

O​n MacOS you can activate Git by typing:

###

*git version*

###

H​owever if it is not installed, or if you want to update it, you can download and install the latest version of the [MacOS Git Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect), and run the above command to verify the version.

O​n Windows based systems, you can install Git Bash by downloading the Git for Windows installer.  **Git Bash** includes popular Linux Bash shell commands (such as ls, pwd, cat, etc.) as well as Git commands.

Y​ou can also get the [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Windows and MacOS, which provides a UI for GitHub on your desktop.

W​hen you are working with GitHub repositories from your desktop you will also need to setup an ssh key. 

**The remaining labs in this module are optional however recommended for those with a Windows desktop.** In the following labs you will install Git Bash on your Windows machine, and configure an ssh key to work with your GitHub repo using Git commands on your system.
